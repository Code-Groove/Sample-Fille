    <marquee>Causes of the Revolt of 1857</marquee>
    <p class="username1">
      The Indian Rebellion of 1857 occurred as the result of an accumulation of
      factors over time, rather than any single event. The sepoys were Indian
      soldiers who were recruited into the Company's army. Just before the
      rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about
      50,000 British. The forces were divided into three presidency armies:
      Bombay, Madras, and Bengal. The Bengal Army recruited higher castes, such
      as Rajputs and Bhumihar, mostly from the Awadh and Bihar regions, and even
      restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the Madras
      Army and Bombay Army were "more localized, caste-neutral armies" that "did
      not prefer high-caste men".[30] The domination of higher castes in the
      Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the
      rebellion. Two sepoy officers; a private sepoy, 1820s In 1772, when Warren
      Hastings was appointed India's first Governor-General, one of his first
      undertakings was the rapid expansion of the Company's army. Since the
      sepoys from Bengal – many of whom had fought against the Company in the
      Battles of Plassey and Buxar – were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings
      recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of
      Awadh and Bihar, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However,
      in order to forestall any social friction, the Company also took action to
      adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious
      rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in
      addition, overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not
      required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu
      festivals. "This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left
      the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys
      detected infringement of their prerogatives."[31] Stokes argues that "The
      British scrupulously avoided interference with the social structure of the
      village community which remained largely intact.

      After the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856,
      many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed
      gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased
      land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about.[33] Other
      historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting
      the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced
      that the Company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims
      to Christianity.[34] Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as
      William Carey and William Wilberforce had successfully clamoured for the
      passage of social reform, such as the abolition of sati and allowing the
      remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys'
      allegiance was affected by this.[33] However, changes in the terms of
      their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of
      the East India Company's jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or
      annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in less
      familiar regions, such as in Burma, but also to make do without the
      "foreign service" remuneration that had previously been their due.[35] A
      major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of
      the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment Act of 25 July 1856. As
      noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas
      service. Specifically, they were enlisted only for service in territories
      to which they could march. Governor-General Lord Dalhousie saw this as an
      anomaly, since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six
      "General Service" battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted an obligation
      to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing
      contingents for active service in Burma, readily accessible only by sea,
      and China had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency
      Armies. As signed into effect by Lord Canning, Dalhousie's successor as
      Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to
      accept a commitment for general service. However, serving high-caste
      sepoys were fearful that it would be eventually extended to them, as well
      as preventing sons following fathers into an army with a strong tradition
      of family service.[36] There were also grievances over the issue of
      promotions, based on seniority. This, as well as the increasing number of
      British officers in the battalions,[37] made promotion slow, and many
      Indian officers did not reach commissioned rank until they were too old to
      be effective.

    <center>h1 class="secondheading">THE ENFIELD RIFLE</h1>
        </center>
    <p class="username3">
      The final spark was provided by the ammunition for the new Enfield Pattern
      1853 rifled musket.[39] These rifles, which fired Minié balls, had a
      tighter fit than the earlier muskets, and used paper cartridges that came
      pre-greased. To load the rifle, sepoys had to bite the cartridge open to
      release the powder.[40] The grease used on these cartridges was rumoured
      to include tallow derived from beef, which would be offensive to
      Hindus,[41] and lard derived from pork, which would be offensive to
      Muslims. At least one Company official pointed out the difficulties this
      might cause: unless it be proven that the grease employed in these
      cartridges is not of a nature to offend or interfere with the prejudices
      of religion, it will be expedient not to issue them for test to Native
      corps.[42] However, in August 1856, greased cartridge production was
      initiated at Fort William, Calcutta, following a British design. The
      grease used included tallow supplied by the Indian firm of Gangadarh
      Banerji & Co.[43] By January, rumours were abroad that the Enfield
      cartridges were greased with animal fat. Company officers became aware of
      the rumours through reports of an altercation between a high-caste sepoy
      and a low-caste labourer at Dum Dum.[44] The labourer had taunted the
      sepoy that by biting the cartridge, he had himself lost caste, although at
      this time such cartridges had been issued only at Meerut and not at Dum
      Dum.[45] There had been rumours that the British sought to destroy the
      religions of the Indian people, and forcing the native soldiers to break
      their sacred code would have certainly added to this rumour, as it
      apparently did. The Company was quick to reverse the effects of this
      policy in hopes that the unrest would be quelled.[46][47] On 27 January,
      Colonel Richard Birch, the Military Secretary, ordered that all cartridges
      issued from depots were to be free from grease, and that sepoys could
      grease them themselves using whatever mixture "they may prefer".[48] A
      modification was also made to the drill for loading so that the cartridge
      was torn with the hands and not bitten. This, however, merely caused many
      sepoys to be convinced that the rumours were true and that their fears
      were justified. Additional rumours started that the paper in the new
      cartridges, which was glazed and stiffer than the previously used paper,
      was impregnated with grease.[49] In February, a court of inquiry was held
      at Barrackpore to get to the bottom of these rumours. Native soldiers
      called as witnesses complained of the paper "being stiff and like cloth in
      the mode of tearing", said that when the paper was burned it smelled of
      grease, and announced that the suspicion that the paper itself contained
      grease could not be removed from their minds.

        </center>
    <p class="username4">
      Civilian rebellion was more multifarious. The rebels consisted of three
      groups: the feudal nobility, rural landlords called taluqdars, and the
      peasants. The nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the
      Doctrine of Lapse, which refused to recognise the adopted children of
      princes as legal heirs, felt that the Company had interfered with a
      traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as Nana Sahib and
      the Rani of Jhansi belonged to this group; the latter, for example, was
      prepared to accept East India Company supremacy if her adopted son was
      recognised as her late husband's heir.[51] In other areas of central
      India, such as Indore and Saugar, where such loss of privilege had not
      occurred, the princes remained loyal to the Company, even in areas where
      the sepoys had rebelled.[52] The second group, the taluqdars, had lost
      half their landed estates to peasant farmers as a result of the land
      reforms that came in the wake of annexation of Oudh. As the rebellion
      gained ground, the taluqdars quickly reoccupied the lands they had lost,
      and paradoxically, in part because of ties of kinship and feudal loyalty,
      did not experience significant opposition from the peasant farmers, many
      of whom joined the rebellion, to the great dismay of the British.[53] It
      has also been suggested that heavy land-revenue assessment in some areas
      by the British resulted in many landowning families either losing their
      land or going into great debt to money lenders, and providing ultimately a
      reason to rebel; money lenders, in addition to the Company, were
      particular objects of the rebels' animosity.[54] The civilian rebellion
      was also highly uneven in its geographic distribution, even in areas of
      north-central India that were no longer under British control. For
      example, the relatively prosperous Muzaffarnagar district, a beneficiary
      of a Company irrigation scheme, and next door to Meerut, where the
      upheaval began, stayed relatively calm throughout.

        <h1 class="fourthheading">THE BENGAL ARMY</h1>
    </center>
    <p class="username5">
        Each of the three "Presidencies" into which the East India Company divided India for administrative purposes maintained their own armies. Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units[63] within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. The sepoys were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning Brahmins and Rajputs of the Bihar and Awadh regions. These soldiers were known as Purbiyas. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.[64]
    The sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after Awadh and the Punjab were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (batta or bhatta) for service there, because they were no longer considered "foreign missions". The junior British officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors. In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the Company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply only to new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well.[65] A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution.
