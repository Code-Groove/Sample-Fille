    <p>World War Two began on 2nd September 1939 when Germany attacked Poland from the west. They forcibly conquered
        it brutally. Actually, Germany had an alliance wih Russia that Eastern Poland woud be theirs and Western Poland
        would go to Germany. So Russia also helped Germany by destroying Eastern Poland with their Red Army.</p>
    <p>Millions of people lost their houses as Hitler was following his polocy of <i
            class="i1"><b><u>Lebensraum</u></b></i>
        where his plans was to displace the locals of the conquered territories and bring in Ethnic- Nordic Aryans
        from Germany and Austria. I know it was a crazy idea, but Hitler was Hitler. He wouldn't listen to anyone.
        His own generals advised him not to take such a step but Hitler was adamant. He took the risk and went on
        with his plan.

        Initially, Germany went rampant in Poland. They forcibly walked into Poland with a lot of successess despite the
        resistance by the Polish Army. Hitler was clever and cunning. He ordered the army not to touch the houses and the
        factories that were made earlier as he could use them later for production of armaments and the houses as a
        rest-house for the  soldiers.

        By the end of October in 1939, Poland was completely conquered. It was a strategic location because of the
        Port of Danzig. It was located to the North of Poland. In 1938, Hitler petitioned Poland to grant him access
        to the Port of Danzig to which the Poles disagreed. But now Danzig was his. He was free to block the shipping
        between any Northern Europe country by sending his Navy from Danzig and blocking all trade from Western
        Europe to other countries. Meanwhile, the Russians went on a violent campaign across Poland. The Russian
        infantry was its strength. Josef Stalin, the dictator of Russia, had about 15 million active soldiers and 10
        million more in reserves. He wanted to use his men cleverly unlike Hitler who sent his entire army to Poland.

        You might get a question. What were the other nations doing when Hitler was brutally conquering territories???
        Well, the Allies; namely Great Britain, France, Spain, USA, Japan and Romania sat quiet. They were into a
        thinking that Germany was just re-acquiring their lost territories after World War One. Originally, Poland
        actually belonged to Germany but it was snatched by the Allies and declared an independent nation by the
        League of Nations formed after WORLD WAR ONE. Britain and France sat quiet. They thought that Germany would stop
        with Eastern Poland. But they were wrong. Germany went on and conquered the whole of Poland. <p>The press in Britain
        and France were enraged. Both the governments warned Germany to stop their campaign. But Hitler didn't listen. 
        Instead, he drove his army into <b>Czechoslovakia</b> and conquered that country too. This was when Britain and
        France launched their armies too battle. Britain was practically undefeatable in 2 aspects; namely Infantry and
        Navy. Britain had the strongest Navy of the whole world. But they had a huge weak point. THE AIR FORCE. </p>
    <p>The Royal
        Air Force wasn't as strong as Germany Luftwaffe. They had only 400-500 fighters and 300 bombers whereas Germany
    had a strength of 2000 in their Air Force all together.</p>
