    <p class="username1">
      In June, sepoys under General Wheeler in Cawnpore (now Kanpur) rebelled
      and besieged the British entrenchment. Wheeler was not only a veteran and
      respected soldier but also married to a high-caste Indian woman. He had
      relied on his own prestige, and his cordial relations with the Nana Sahib
      to thwart rebellion, and took comparatively few measures to prepare
      fortifications and lay in supplies and ammunition. The besieged endured
      three weeks of the Siege of Cawnpore with little water or food, suffering
      continuous casualties to men, women and children. On 25 June Nana Sahib
      made an offer of safe passage to Allahabad. With barely three days' food
      rations remaining, the British agreed provided they could keep their small
      arms and that the evacuation should take place in daylight on the morning
      of the 27th (the Nana Sahib wanted the evacuation to take place on the
      night of the 26th). Early in the morning of 27 June, the British party
      left their entrenchment and made their way to the river where boats
      provided by the Nana Sahib were waiting to take them to Allahabad.[109]
      Several sepoys who had stayed loyal to the Company were removed by the
      mutineers and killed, either because of their loyalty or because "they had
      become Christian". A few injured British officers trailing the column were
      also apparently hacked to death by angry sepoys. After the British party
      had largely arrived at the dock, which was surrounded by sepoys positioned
      on both banks of the Ganges,[110] with clear lines of fire, firing broke
      out and the boats were abandoned by their crew, and caught or were
      set[111] on fire using pieces of red hot charcoal.[112] The British party
      tried to push the boats off but all except three remained stuck. One boat
      with over a dozen wounded men initially escaped, but later grounded, was
      caught by mutineers and pushed back down the river towards the carnage at
      Cawnpore. Towards the end rebel cavalry rode into the water to finish off
      any survivors.[112] After the firing ceased the survivors were rounded up
      and the men shot.[112] By the time the massacre was over, most of the male
      members of the party were dead while the surviving women and children were
      removed and held hostage to be later killed in the Bibighar massacre.[113]
      Only four men eventually escaped alive from Cawnpore on one of the boats:
      two private soldiers, a lieutenant, and Captain Mowbray Thomson, who wrote
      a first-hand account of his experiences entitled The Story of Cawnpore
      (London, 1859). During his trial, Tatya Tope denied the existence of any
      such plan and described the incident in the following terms: the British
      had already boarded the boats and Tatya Tope raised his right hand to
      signal their departure. That very moment someone from the crowd blew a
      loud bugle, which created disorder and in the ongoing bewilderment, the
      boatmen jumped off the boats. The rebels started shooting
      indiscriminately. Nana Sahib, who was staying in Savada Kothi (Bungalow)
      nearby, was informed about what was happening and immediately came to stop
      it.[114] Some British histories allow that it might well have been the
      result of accident or error; someone accidentally or maliciously fired a
      shot, the panic-stricken British opened fire, and it became impossible to
      stop the massacre.[115] The surviving women and children were taken to the
      Nana Sahib and then confined first to the Savada Kothi and then to the
      home of the local magistrate's clerk (the Bibighar)[116] where they were
      joined by refugees from Fatehgarh. Overall five men and two hundred and
      six women and children were confined in The Bibigarh for about two weeks.
      In one week 25 were brought out dead, from dysentery and cholera.[111]
      Meanwhile, a Company relief force that had advanced from Allahabad
      defeated the Indians and by 15 July it was clear that the Nana Sahib would
      not be able to hold Cawnpore and a decision was made by the Nana Sahib and
      other leading rebels that the hostages must be killed. After the sepoys
      refused to carry out this order, two Muslim butchers, two Hindu peasants
      and one of Nana's bodyguards went into The Bibigarh. Armed with knives and
      hatchets they murdered the women and children.[117] After the massacre the
      walls were covered in bloody hand prints, and the floor littered with
      fragments of human limbs.[118] The dead and the dying were thrown down a
      nearby well. When the 50-foot (15 m) deep well was filled with remains to
      within 6 feet (1.8 m) of the top,[119] the remainder were thrown into the
      Ganges.[120] Historians have given many reasons for this act of cruelty.
      With Company forces approaching Cawnpore and some believing that they
      would not advance if there were no hostages to save, their murders were
      ordered. Or perhaps it was to ensure that no information was leaked after
      the fall of Cawnpore. Other historians have suggested that the killings
      were an attempt to undermine Nana Sahib's relationship with the
      British.[121] Perhaps it was due to fear, the fear of being recognised by
      some of the prisoners for having taken part in the earlier firings. The
      killing of the women and children hardened British attitudes against the
      sepoys. The British public was aghast and the anti-Imperial and pro-Indian
      proponents lost all their support. Cawnpore became a war cry for the
      British and their allies for the rest of the conflict. Nana Sahib
      disappeared near the end of the Rebellion and it is not known what
      happened to him. Other British accounts[122][123][124] state that
      indiscriminate punitive measures were taken in early June, two weeks
      before the murders at the Bibighar (but after those at both Meerut and
      Delhi), specifically by Lieutenant Colonel James George Smith Neill of the
      Madras Fusiliers, commanding at Allahabad while moving towards Cawnpore.
      At the nearby town of Fatehpur, a mob had attacked and murdered the local
      British population. On this pretext, Neill ordered all villages beside the
      Grand Trunk Road to be burned and their inhabitants to be killed by
      hanging. Neill's methods were "ruthless and horrible"[125] and far from
      intimidating the population, may well have induced previously undecided
      sepoys and communities to revolt. Neill was killed in action at Lucknow on
      26 September and was never called to account for his punitive measures,
      though contemporary British sources lionised him and his "gallant blue
      caps".[126] When the British retook Cawnpore, the soldiers took their
      sepoy prisoners to the Bibighar and forced them to lick the bloodstains
      from the walls and floor.[127] They then hanged or "blew from the cannon",
      the traditional Mughal punishment for mutiny, the majority of the sepoy
      prisoners. Although some claimed the sepoys took no actual part in the
      killings themselves, they did not act to stop it and this was acknowledged
      by Captain Thompson after the British departed Cawnpore for a second time.

    <p class="username2">
      Very soon after the events at Meerut, rebellion erupted in the state of
      Awadh (also known as Oudh, in modern-day Uttar Pradesh), which had been
      annexed barely a year before. The British Commissioner resident at
      Lucknow, Sir Henry Lawrence, had enough time to fortify his position
      inside the Residency compound. The defenders, including loyal sepoys,
      numbered some 1700 men. The rebels' assaults were unsuccessful, so they
      began a barrage of artillery and musket fire into the compound. Lawrence
      was one of the first casualties. He was succeeded by John Eardley Inglis.
      The rebels tried to breach the walls with explosives and bypass them via
      tunnels that led to underground close combat.[107]:486 After 90 days of
      siege, the defenders were reduced to 300 loyal sepoys, 350 British
      soldiers and 550 non-combatants. On 25 September, a relief column under
      the command of Sir Henry Havelock and accompanied by Sir James Outram (who
      in theory was his superior) fought its way from Cawnpore to Lucknow in a
      brief campaign, in which the numerically small column defeated rebel
      forces in a series of increasingly large battles. This became known as
      'The First Relief of Lucknow', as this force was not strong enough to
      break the siege or extricate themselves, and so was forced to join the
      garrison. In October, another larger army under the new
      Commander-in-Chief, Sir Colin Campbell, was finally able to relieve the
      garrison and on 18 November, they evacuated the defended enclave within
      the city, the women and children leaving first. They then conducted an
      orderly withdrawal, firstly to Alambagh 4 miles (6.4 km) north where a
      force of 4,000 were left to construct a fort, then to Cawnpore, where they
      defeated an attempt by Tantia Tope to recapture the city in the Second
      Battle of Cawnpore. In March 1858, Campbell once again advanced on Lucknow
      with a large army, meeting up with the force at Alambagh, this time
      seeking to suppress the rebellion in Awadh. He was aided by a large
      Nepalese contingent advancing from the north under Jung Bahadur Kunwar
      Rana.[128] General Dhir Shamsher Kunwar Rana, the youngest brother of Jung
      Bahadur, also led the Nepalese forces in various parts of India including
      Lucknow, Benares and Patna.[2][129] Campbell's advance was slow and
      methodical, with a force under General Outram crossing the river on cask
      bridges on 4 March to enable them to fire artillery in flank. Campbell
      drove the large but disorganised rebel army from Lucknow with the final
      fighting taking place on 21 March.[107]:491 There were few casualties to
      Campbell's own troops, but his cautious movements allowed large numbers of
      the rebels to disperse into Awadh. Campbell was forced to spend the summer
      and autumn dealing with scattered pockets of resistance while losing men
      to heat, disease and guerrilla actions.

      Colonel Henry Marion Durand, the then-Company resident at Indore, had
      brushed away any possibility of uprising in Indore.[132] However, on 1
      July, sepoys in Holkar's army revolted and opened fire on the cavalry
      pickets of the Bhopal Contingent (a locally raised force with British
      officers). When Colonel Travers rode forward to charge, the Bhopal Cavalry
      refused to follow. The Bhopal Infantry also refused orders and instead
      levelled their guns at British sergeants and officers. Since all
      possibility of mounting an effective deterrent was lost, Durand decided to
      gather up all the British residents and escape, although 39 British
      residents of Indore were killed. The rebellion in Bihar was mainly
      concentrated in the Western regions of the state; however, there were also
      some outbreaks of plundering and looting in Gaya district.[134] One of the
      central figures was Kunwar Singh, the 80-year-old Rajput Zamindar of
      Jagdispur, whose estate was in the process of being sequestrated by the
      Revenue Board, instigated and assumed the leadership of revolt in
      Bihar.[135] His efforts were supported by his brother Babu Amar Singh and
      his commander-in-chief Hare Krishna Singh.[136] On 25 July, mutiny erupted
      in the garrisons of Danapur. Mutinying sepoys from the 7th, 8th and 40th
      regiments of Bengal Native Infantry quickly moved towards the city of
      Arrah and were joined by Kunwar Singh and his men.[137] Mr. Boyle, a
      British railway engineer in Arrah, had already prepared an outbuilding on
      his property for defence against such attacks.[138] As the rebels
      approached Arrah, all British residents took refuge at Mr. Boyle's
      house.[139] A siege soon ensued – eighteen civilians and 50 loyal sepoys
      from the Bengal Military Police Battalion under the command of Herwald
      Wake, the local magistrate, defended the house against artillery and
      musketry fire from an estimated 2000 to 3000 mutineers and rebels.[140] On
      29 July, 400 men were sent out from Danapur to relieve Arrah, but this
      force was ambushed by the rebels around a mile away from the siege house,
      severely defeated, and driven back. On 30 July, Major Vincent Eyre, who
      was going up the river with his troops and guns, reached Buxar and heard
      about the siege. He immediately disembarked his guns and troops (the 5th
      Fusiliers) and started marching towards Arrah, disregarding direct orders
      not to do so.[141] On 2 August, some 6 miles (9.7 km) short of Arrah, the
      Major was ambushed by the mutineers and rebels. After an intense fight,
      the 5th Fusiliers charged and stormed the rebel positions
      successfully.[140] On 3 August, Major Eyre and his men reached the siege
      house and successfully ended the siege.[142][143] After receiving
      reinforcements, Major Eyre pursued Kunwar Singh to his palace in
      Jagdispur; however, Singh had left by the time Eyre's forces arrived. Eyre
      then proceeded to destroy the palace and the homes of Singh's
      brothers.[140] In addition to Kunwar Singh's efforts, there were also
      rebellions carried out by Hussain Baksh Khan, Ghulam Ali Khan and Fateh
      Singh among others in Gaya, Nawada and Jehanabad districts.[144] In
      Lohardaga district of South Bihar (now in Jharkhand), a major rebellion
      was led by Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo who was part of the Nagavanshi
      dynasty.[145] He was motivated by disputes he had with the Christian Kol
      tribals who had been grabbing his land and were implicitly supported by
      the British authorities. The rebels in South Bihar asked him to lead them
      and he readily accepted this offer. He organised a Mukti Vahini (people's
      army) with the assistance of nearby zamindars including Pandey Ganpat Rai
      and Nadir Ali Khan.

    <p class="username4">
      What was then referred to by the British as the Punjab was a very large
      administrative division, centred on Lahore. It included not only the
      present-day Indian and Pakistani Punjabi regions but also the North West
      Frontier districts bordering Afghanistan. Much of the region had been the
      Sikh Empire, ruled by Ranjit Singh until his death in 1839. The kingdom
      had then fallen into disorder, with court factions and the Khalsa (the
      Sikh army) contending for power at the Lahore Durbar (court). After two
      Anglo-Sikh Wars, the entire region was annexed by the East India Company
      in 1849. In 1857, the region still contained the highest numbers of both
      British and Indian troops. The inhabitants of the Punjab were not as
      sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited
      many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments
      of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably Ferozepore,
      indecision on the part of the senior British officers allowed the sepoys
      to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for
      Delhi.[146] At the most important garrison, that of Peshawar close to the
      Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal
      commander, General Reed, and took decisive action. They intercepted the
      sepoys' mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a
      force known as the "Punjab Movable Column" to move rapidly to suppress any
      revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted
      correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of
      open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were
      disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed
      by artillery, on 22 May. This decisive act induced many local chieftains
      to side with the British.[147] Marble Lectern in memory of 35 British
      soldiers in Jhelum Jhelum in Punjab saw a mutiny of native troops against
      the British. Here 35 British soldiers of Her Majesty's 24th Regiment of
      Foot (South Wales Borderers) were killed by mutineers on 7 July 1857.
      Among the dead was Captain Francis Spring, the eldest son of Colonel
      William Spring. To commemorate this event St. John's Church Jhelum was
      built and the names of those 35 British soldiers are carved on a marble
      lectern present in that church. The final large-scale military uprising in
      the Punjab took place on 9 July, when most of a brigade of sepoys at
      Sialkot rebelled and began to move to Delhi.[148] They were intercepted by
      John Nicholson with an equal British force as they tried to cross the Ravi
      River. After fighting steadily but unsuccessfully for several hours, the
      sepoys tried to fall back across the river but became trapped on an
      island. Three days later, Nicholson annihilated the 1,100 trapped sepoys
      in the Battle of Trimmu Ghat.[149] The British had been recruiting
      irregular units from Sikh and Pakhtun communities even before the first
      unrest among the Bengal units, and the numbers of these were greatly
      increased during the Rebellion, 34,000 fresh levies eventually being
      raised.[150] Lieutenant William Alexander Kerr, 24th Bombay Native
      Infantry, near Kolapore, July 1857 At one stage, faced with the need to
      send troops to reinforce the besiegers of Delhi, the Commissioner of the
      Punjab (Sir John Lawrence) suggested handing the coveted prize of Peshawar
      to Dost Mohammed Khan of Afghanistan in return for a pledge of friendship.
      The British Agents in Peshawar and the adjacent districts were horrified.
      Referring to the massacre of a retreating British army in 1842, Herbert
      Edwardes wrote, "Dost Mahomed would not be a mortal Afghan ... if he did
      not assume our day to be gone in India and follow after us as an enemy.
      British cannot retreat – Kabul would come again."[151] In the event Lord
      Canning insisted on Peshawar being held, and Dost Mohammed, whose
      relations with Britain had been equivocal for over 20 years, remained
      neutral. In September 1858 Rai Ahmad Khan Kharal, head of the Khurrul
      tribe, led an insurrection in the Neeli Bar district, between the Sutlej,
      Ravi and Chenab rivers. The rebels held the jungles of Gogaira and had
      some initial successes against the British forces in the area, besieging
      Major Crawford Chamberlain at Chichawatni. A squadron of Punjabi cavalry
      sent by Sir John Lawrence raised the siege. Ahmed Khan was killed but the
      insurgents found a new leader in Mahr Bahawal Fatyana, who maintained the
      uprising for three months until Government forces penetrated the jungle
      and scattered the rebel tribesmen. In September 1857, sepoys took control
      of the treasury in Chittagong.[153] The treasury remained under rebel
      control for several days. Further mutinies on 18 November saw the 2nd, 3rd
      and 4th companies of the 34th Bengal Infantry Regiment storming the
      Chittagong Jail and releasing all prisoners. The mutineers were eventually
      suppressed by the Gurkha regiments.[154] The mutiny also spread to Kolkata
      and later Dacca, the former Mughal capital of Bengal. Residents in the
      city's Lalbagh area were kept awake at night by the rebellion.[155] Sepoys
      joined hands with the common populace in Jalpaiguri to take control of the
      city's cantonment.[153] In January 1858, many sepoys received shelter from
      the royal family of the princely state of Hill Tippera.[153] The interior
      areas of Bengal proper were already experiencing growing resistance to
      Company rule due to the Muslim Faraizi movement.

      In central and north Gujarat, the rebellion was sustained by land owner
      Jagirdars, Talukdars and Thakors with the support of armed communities of
      Bhil, Koli, Pathans and Arabs, unlike the mutiny by sepoys in north India.
      Their main opposition of British was due to Inam commission. The Bet
      Dwarka island, along with Okhamandal region of Kathiawar peninsula which
      was under Gaekwad of Baroda State, saw a revolt by the Waghers in January
      1858 who, by July 1859, controlled that region. In October 1859, a joint
      offensive by British, Gaekwad and other princely states troops ousted the
      rebels and recaptured the region.During the rebellion, Surendra Sai was
      one of the many people broken out of Hazaribagh jail by mutineers.[159] In
      the middle of September Surendra established himself in Sambalpur's old
      fort. He quickly organised a meeting with the Assistant Comissioner
      (Captain Leigh), and Leigh agreed to ask the government to cancel his and
      his brother's imprisonment while Surendra dispersed his followers. This
      agreement was soon broken, however, when on the 31st of September escaped
      the town and make for Khinda, where his brother was located with a 1,400
      man force.[159] The British quickly moved to send two companies from the
      40th Madras Native Infantry from Cuttack on October 10th, and after a
      forced march reached Khinda on November 5th, only to find the place
      abandoned as the rebels retreated to the jungle. Much of the country of
      Sambalpur was under the rebels' control, and they maintained a hit and run
      guerrilla war for quite some time. In December the British made further
      preparations to crush the uprising in Sambalpur, and it was temporarily
      transferred from the Chota Nagpur Division into the Orissa Division of the
      Bengal Presidency. On the 30th a major battle was fought in which
      Surendra's brother was killed and the mutineers were routed. In January
      the British achieved minor successes, capturing a few major villages like
      Kolabira, and in February calm began to be restored. However, Surendra
      still held out, and the jungle hampered British parties from capturing
      him. Additionally, any native daring to collaborate with the British were
      terrorized along with their family. After a new policy that promised
      amnesty for mutineers, Surendra surrendered in May 1862.

    <p class="username6">
      Jhansi State was a Maratha-ruled princely state in Bundelkhand. When the
      Raja of Jhansi died without a biological male heir in 1853, it was annexed
      to the British Raj by the Governor-General of India under the doctrine of
      lapse. His widow Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi, protested against
      the denial of rights of their adopted son. When war broke out, Jhansi
      quickly became a centre of the rebellion. A small group of Company
      officials and their families took refuge in Jhansi Fort, and the Rani
      negotiated their evacuation. However, when they left the fort they were
      massacred by the rebels over whom the Rani had no control; the British
      suspected the Rani of complicity, despite her repeated denials. By the end
      of June 1857, the Company had lost control of much of Bundelkhand and
      eastern Rajasthan. The Bengal Army units in the area, having rebelled,
      marched to take part in the battles for Delhi and Cawnpore. The many
      princely states that made up this area began warring amongst themselves.
      In September and October 1857, the Rani led the successful defence of
      Jhansi against the invading armies of the neighbouring rajas of Datia and
      Orchha. On 3 February, Sir Hugh Rose broke the 3-month siege of Saugor.
      Thousands of local villagers welcomed him as a liberator, freeing them
      from rebel occupation.[130] In March 1858, the Central India Field Force,
      led by Sir Hugh Rose, advanced on and laid siege to Jhansi. The Company
      forces captured the city, but the Rani fled in disguise. After being
      driven from Jhansi and Kalpi, on 1 June 1858 Rani Lakshmi Bai and a group
      of Maratha rebels captured the fortress city of Gwalior from the Scindia
      rulers, who were British allies. This might have reinvigorated the
      rebellion but the Central India Field Force very quickly advanced against
      the city. The Rani died on 17 June, the second day of the Battle of
      Gwalior, probably killed by a carbine shot from the 8th King's Royal Irish
      Hussars according to the account of three independent Indian
      representatives. The Company forces recaptured Gwalior within the next
      three days. In descriptions of the scene of her last battle, she was
      compared to Joan of Arc by some commentators.
