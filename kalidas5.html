	<p>
	India’s spiritual values and high moral tone expressed through her immortal Sanskrit literature was to make a great impact on the minds of creative writers in the West. The famous Abhijnana Shakuntalam of the fourth-century poet Kalidasa was in demand in the West for India’s eternal values as they are reflected in her immortal literature touched the very core of the Western mind. Prof. Sylvan Levi wrote:</p>

<p>The name of Kalidasa dominates Indian poetry and epitomizes it brilliantly. The drama, a grand and scholarly epic, a truly classical master piece, which India admires and humanity recognizes. The praise which is saluting the birth of Shakuntala at Ujjayini, has existed over long centuries, bringing illumination from one world to the other since William Jones revealed it to the West. (Jawaharlal Nehru, The Discovery of India, Calcutta 1946, 175).</p>


<p>The best proof of a poet’s greatness is the inability of men to live without him; in other words, his power to win and hold through centuries the love and admiration of his own people, especially when that people has shown itself capable of high intellectual and spiritual achievement.(Arthur W. Ryder, Kalidasa: Translations of Shakuntala and other works, Everyman’s Library Series, Poetry and The Drama, Ernst Rhys ed., London and New York, 1912, xvii).</p>



<p>In literature, our epics and poems and drama rank as high as those of any language; our Shaguntala(Shakuntala) was summarized by Germany’s greatest poet as heaven and earth united (Complete Works, II, 511-12).


In The Discovery of India, Nehru pointed out that Indian philosophy was felt by Europeans- characteristically ambivalent about the tremendous stimulus of Indian thought on western civilization- to fulfill a need that their own culture has failed to meet (174-5).

The German naturalist, traveler and statesman Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) wrote about Indian poetry and observed that Kalidasa, the celebrated author of the Sakoontala, is a masterly describer of the influence which Nature exercises upon the minds of lovers. This great poet flourished at the splendid court of Vikramaditya, and was, therefore, contemporary with Virgil and Horace. Tenderness in the expression of feeling, and richness of creative fancy, have assigned to him his lofty place among the poets of all nations.</p>

<p>Will Durant highlighted the impact of Sakuntala when he addressed the need for a deeper study of India’s culture in The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage:

In 1789 Sir William Jones opened his career as one of the greatest Indologist by translating Kalidasa’s Shakuntala; this translation, re-rendered into German in 1791, profoundly affected Herder and Goethe, and through the Schlegels- the entire Romantic movement.

Jones’s Shakuntala inspires other English scholars: Kalidasa’ss Abhijnana Shakuntala was the first Sanskrit drama ever to be translated into a European language by Sir William Jones in 1789 to display an example of India’s treasures of Hindu drama to an admiring Europe. Jones actually completed his first translation of Kalidasa’s drama in Latin then rendered it word for word into English, without suppressing any material sentence and disengaged it from the stiffness of a foreign idiom and prepared the faithful translation. (Dorothy Matilda Figueira, Translating the Orient, The Reception of Sakuntala in Nineteenth Century Europe, Albany, 1991, 26). Jones translated Shakuntalam into English as Shakuntala or the Fatal Ring, it took only a decade for him to achieve international fame as the translator of Shakuntala, incomparable in Goethe’s estimation(quoted in Raymond Schwab, The Oriental Renaissance:Europe’s Discovery of India and the East, 1680-1880, New York, 1984, 63). In Goethe’s correspondence and diaries it is revealed that it held a special place in Goethe’s heart.</p>


<p>From Jones’s translation, others sprang up in German, French, Danish and Italian. Shakuntala became one of the most circulated Indian masterpieces- it was reprinted five times in England between 1790 and 1807 and it was retranslated and published many times throughout Europe.(Oriental Renaissance, 51,53). The century after Jones translated it, Shakuntala appeared in forty-six translations in twelve different languages in Europe.

Jones went on to translate another of Kalidasa’s poems, Ritusamhara, in 1792. He published it in Calcutta as The Seasons, A Descriptive Poem. (Oriental Renaissance, 31). His English translation of Shakuntala, together with his Hymns to Narayana, were studied with fond devotion by Percy Bysshe Shelly(1792-1822), Robert Southey(1774-1843), Thomas Moore(1779-1857), Alfred Tennyson(1850-1892) and other nineteenth-century English poets.(Marie E.D.Meester, Oriental Influence in the English Literature of the Early Nineteenth Century, 10). They read his works with admiration and quoted him. Thanks to the influence of Jones’ Shakuntala and Hymns to Narayana, Shelly was able to overcome his atheistic and materialistic tendencies(P.V. De Sola, Sir William Jones and English Literature, 694).</p>

<p>English Indologist Sir Charles Wilkins(1750-1836), whose translation of the Bhagavad Gita had the greatest impact in Europe, returned to England in 1786 after sixteen years in India. Wilkins fitted a printing press in Bath, England, with Devanagari characters and from this press, he printed his Story of Shakuntala from the Mahabharata in 1793. Around the nineteenth century, a new cultural and literary currency was being wrought in Europe, with India playing a significant role in England’s Romantic period. Jones’ work, particularly Shakuntala, pervaded England through her thinkers and poets.</p>

<p>In 1853, the Sanskrit-English lexicographer, Sir Monier Monier-Williams(1819-1899) came under the eternal charm of Sanskrit. In his Sakoontala or The Lost Ring: An Indian Drama, Translated into Prose and Verse from the Sanskrit of Kalidasa, Monier Williams presented the English public with a free translation of Shakuntala. It was published in 1855 followed by a second edition in 1876. In his Introduction he wrote:</p>



<p>Her critical analysis of the text fulfills the objective of addressing the specific problems encountered in cross-cultural translation to serve the nobler purpose of greater understanding between all the cultures of the world. Figueira affirms that the literary event of the discovery and translation of Shakuntala â€œopened up not only the boundaries of humanism, but also fostered a widespread reevaluation of national literaturesâ€¦in the ability of all ethnic groups to produce great art.</p>

 

<p>Misuses: (Discovery of Sanskrit by the west is not without its seamy side. Starting with the translation of Veda by Max Muller, establishment of Boden Chair at Oxford for Sanskrit studies, there have been many attempts to hijack Veda and Sanskrit from their roots and press them in the service of christian evangelism and western imperialism. There were also some pedantic Germans who used Shakuntala to promote their parochial agenda. Gobineau’s attempts to extract support for his race theory from Sanskrit literature is an example. Max Muller’s shortsighted pronouncements on the time of Vedas and his Arya-Dasa racial categorization without any internal or external support whatsoever, left a dangerous legacy in the form of the nefarious Aryan Invasion Theory with its inspiration to Dravidian-Dalit politics and various other separatist movements presently aided and abetted by the Western Churches, governments, academia and other agencies(for details seeBreaking India by Rajiv Malhotra and Aravindan Neelakandan)).</p>

<p>Further Observations on the Universal Influence of Sanskrit Through Shakuntala:</p>

<p>The universal impact of the Sanskrit language through the ages is twofold. It helps the individual to go beyond a finite concept of self and worldly personality with which he has solely identified and develop a divine personality. Sanskrit accomplishes this through the medium of the Indian sacred and classical literature. Sanskrit conveys through India’s literature the eternal, the universal and the spiritual in man,urging people to discover their spiritual consciousness. The Upanishads and other sacred Hindu texts introduced to the west are the great conveyors of spititual enlightenment to the world. Sanskrit is also uniquely suited to have an eternal and boundless relationship with the world due to its continuity in Indian tradition and culture.

As one of the most circulated Sanskrit translations, Kalidasa’s Abhijnana Shakuntalam provides a radiant example of the continuous attraction for the immortal Sanskrit works in the modern West. Jones’ Shakuntala was reprinted five times in England between 1790 and 1807 and retranslated and published many times throughout Europe. Figueira sheds new light on the far reaching influence in the West of Kalidasa’s masterpiece.</p>

<p>Beyond the tribute of so many translations, Europeans embraced Shakuntala in their own fashion. Her story was adopted, parodied, sung and danced. In 1895, Andre Ferdinand Herold’s adaptation, LAnneau de Sakuntala, was performed and well received at the Theatre de l Oeuvre in Paris.(Translating the Orient, 185,230). Herder proceeded to base his construction of the Indian origin of the human race on Shakuntala. His Indeen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit(Ideas on the Philosophy of History) laid foundation to the philosophy of history. He introduced Shakuntala as a new model in dramaturgy.(Herder, Samtliche Werke, B.Suphan, ed. (Berlin,1877-1913) cited from Translating the Orient, 13-14).</p>

<p>Shakuntala uniquely led the many European operas that were set in India in the 18th and 19th century. It was the only Sanskrit text adapted to music, though few of the Shakuntala operas are left to posterity. Those composed by Schubert, Tomaschek, Hopffer, Flotow and Perfall are gone for ever, as are others that were performed in Germany Balduin Zimmermann(Erfurt, 1905), Ferdinand Hummel(Berlin, 1903) and Antonin Modharelli(Augsburg, 1930) (Translating the Orient, 189, 233). Some of the opera versions that passed into musical melodramas, including those of Felix Weingartner(Weimar, 1884) and L.P.Scharwenka(1885)(Translating the Orient, 189). They are evidence of the fascination and function of Shakuntala in the collective mind of the West. Shakuntala continues to fascinate. In 1962, M.B.Emeneau published a new translation in California.(Shakuntala, Kanitkar trans.). An adaptation of Franco Alfano’s opera, La Leffenda di Sakuntala originally performed in Italy in 1921, was presented at Ireland’s Wexford Festival in 1982.</p>
