    <article class="ar1"><p> World War Two actually began in 1918 when Germany lost the FIRST WORLD WAR.
        Everyone
    blamed Germany for their defeat in the war. Germany had to pay huge amounts of taxes to Britain, France, Russia and all the
        other allies. Most of their industrially productive parts were snatched by the allies. Watching all of this
        was Adolf Hitler. He had been a brave soldier in the German Wehrmacht. As a soldier, he was awarded the Iron
        Cross for his bravery. Then Hitler became one of the many soldiers who were left with no job after the war
        as the German armed forces were disbanded. He vowed revenge. This was one of the main reasons why he had
        become a dictator later in his life. </p>
        <p> The allies were harsh on Germany. As a  result, there was an Economic Depression whe people were begging
            for basic amenities like food, water, clothing and money. There were millions out on the street
            begigngg
            for employment. In this situation, the German Parliament, or the Weimar Republic recklessly printed
            currency. The value of the German Mark fell.
        </p>
        <p>From such a crisis emerged the <b class="b1">NATIONAL GERMAN SOCIALIST PARTY</b> or the
            <b class="b2">NAZI PARTY</b>. In 1923, Hitler became the leader of the party. In a neighbouring country
            to Germany, Bavaria, Hitler launched a military coup and overthrew the Bavarian Government. So, he was
            jailed for 5 years. In jail, he wrote his book, <i>Mein Kampf</i> or <i>My Struggle</i> in jail. When he
            was released in 1929, he was welcomed with great cheer in Germany. Four years later, he was offered
            Chancellorship of Germany. Hitler agreed. The first thing he did was suspend all civil rights and banning
            all organizations except the Nazi Party. He established the Gestapo, secret police who identified and
            eliminated people who spoke against the Nazis.
        </p>
        <p>After the First World War, the Allies had disbanded the German Armed Forces. Hitler rebuilt them tto
            their full force. They were called <b>The Wehrmacht(land army)</b>, <b>the Kriegsmarine(the Navy)</b> and
            <b>The
                Luftwaffe(the air force)</b> </p>
    </article>
<article class="ar2">
    <p> Hitler worked on the principle <b>"survivial of the fittest"</b>. He felt only those who were born in the
        Pure-Nordic Aryan race had thw right to live. He racially discriminated Jews, Poles, Blacks, cripples and
        his own people born with physical disabilities.</p>
    <p>He started the <b>HOLOCAUST</b> where innocent civilians were rounded up and sent to gas chambers to die. It
        was a brutal act where alomst 8-13 million people died in the span of 12 years. (1933-1945)</p>
