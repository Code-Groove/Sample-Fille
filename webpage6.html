      Both sides committed atrocities against civilians.[r][14] In Oudh alone,
      some estimates put the toll at 150,000 Indians killed during the war, with
      100,000 of them being civilians. The capture of Delhi, Allahabad, Kanpur
      and Lucknow by British forces were followed by general massacres.[163]
      Another notable atrocity was carried out by General Neill who massacred
      thousands of Indian mutineers and Indian civilians suspected of supporting
      the rebellion.[164] The rebels' murder of British women, children and
      wounded soldiers (including sepoys who sided with the British) at
      Cawnpore, and the subsequent printing of the events in the British papers,
      left many British soldiers outraged and seeking revenge. As well as
      hanging mutineers, the British had some "blown from cannon," (an old
      Mughal punishment adopted many years before in India), in which sentenced
      rebels were tied over the mouths of cannons and blown to pieces when the
      cannons were fired.[165][166] A particular act of cruelty on behalf of the
      British troops at Cawnpore included forcing many Muslim or Hindu rebels to
      eat pork or beef, as well as licking buildings freshly stained with blood
      of the dead before subsequent public hangings.[167] Practices of torture
      included "searing with hot irons...dipping in wells and rivers till the
      victim is half suffocated...sequencing the testicles...putting pepper and
      red chillies in the eyes or introducing them into the private parts of men
      and women...prevention of sleep...nipping the flesh with
      pinners...suspension from the branches of a tree...imprisonment in a room
      used for storing lime..."[168] British soldiers also committed sexual
      violence against Indian women as a form of retaliation against the
      rebellion.[169][170] As towns and cities were captured from the sepoys,
      the British soldiers took their revenge on Indian civilians by committing
      atrocities and rapes against Indian women.[171][172] As one account reads,
      The [British] victors retaliated against the civilians [at Fatehpur] by
      sacking villages, raping women, killing children and hanging hundreds of
      men. When the people of Cawnpore [Kanpur] heard this, they feared similar
      retaliation..... At Fatehgarh, for example, when the English defeated the
      enemy, their officers ordered a mass scale killing [of] the rebels and the
      citizens on the spot. General Neill had also ordered Hanging parties....
      No evidence was sought and none given before executing the victim.... When
      the [78th] Highlanders moved to another village, they caught about 140
      men, women and children. They selected sixty men from the group, forced
      them to build the gallows of wooden logs taken from the burning homes.
      They then chose ten men of the group [and] hanged them without any
      evidence or trial. For others, they had reserved flogging and beating to
      teach them a lesson..... At one of the villages, about two thousand
      villagers armed only with their lathis [wooden canes] turned out in
      protest. They stood up to face the [78th] Highlanders. The British troops
      surrounded them and set their village on fire.... The villagers trying to
      escape were shot to death. One soldier describes the incident thus: 'We
      took eighteen of them prisoners; they were all tied together, and we fired
      a volley at them and shot them on the spot' .... Stringing and shooting
      the men in front of their family was a sport the troops enjoyed. Watching
      women stooping and begging for the lives of their men seemed to thrill the
      young soldiers and their officers. The prisoners were made to stand under
      the hot summer sun for hours till they fainted. It was easy to flog them
      when they were half-conscious, otherwise, they would squirm and make it
      hard to strike. Flogging invariably ended in killing of the victims. The
      English wanted to break the faith of their Hindu and Muslim
      prisoners.[173][174][175] Most of the British press, outraged by the
      stories of alleged rape committed by the rebels against British women, as
      well as the killings of British civilians and wounded British soldiers,
      did not advocate clemency of any kind towards the Indian population.[176]
      Governor General Canning ordered moderation in dealing with native
      sensibilities and earned the scornful sobriquet "Clemency Canning" from
      the press[177] and later parts of the British public. In terms of sheer
      numbers, the casualties were much higher on the Indian side. A letter
      published after the fall of Delhi in the Bombay Telegraph and reproduced
      in the British press testified to the scale of the Indian casualties: ....
      All the city's people found within the walls of the city of Delhi when our
      troops entered were bayoneted on the spot, and the number was
      considerable, as you may suppose, when I tell you that in some houses
      forty and fifty people were hiding. These were not mutineers but residents
      of the city, who trusted to our well-known mild rule for pardon. I am glad
      to say they were disappointed.[178] British soldiers looting Qaisar Bagh,
      Lucknow, after its recapture (steel engraving, late 1850s) From the end of
      1857, the British had begun to gain ground again. Lucknow was retaken in
      March 1858. On 8 July 1858, a peace treaty was signed and the rebellion
      ended. The last rebels were defeated in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. By 1859,
      rebel leaders Bakht Khan and Nana Sahib had either been slain or had fled.
      Edward Vibart, a 19-year-old officer whose parents, younger brothers, and
      two of his sisters had died in the Cawnpore massacre,[179] recorded his
      experience: The orders went out to shoot every soul.... It was literally
      murder... I have seen many bloody and awful sights lately but such a one
      as I witnessed yesterday I pray I never see again. The women were all
      spared but their screams on seeing their husbands and sons butchered, were
      most painful... Heaven knows I feel no pity, but when some old grey
      bearded man is brought and shot before your very eyes, hard must be that
      man's heart I think who can look on with indifference ...[180] Execution
      of mutineers by blowing from a gun by the British, 8 September 1857. Some
      British troops adopted a policy of "no prisoners". One officer, Thomas
      Lowe, remembered how on one occasion his unit had taken 76 prisoners –
      they were just too tired to carry on killing and needed a rest, he
      recalled. Later, after a quick trial, the prisoners were lined up with a
      British soldier standing a couple of yards in front of them. On the order
      "fire", they were all simultaneously shot, "swept... from their earthly
      existence". The aftermath of the rebellion has been the focus of new work
      using Indian sources and population studies. In The Last Mughal, historian
      William Dalrymple examines the effects on the Muslim population of Delhi
      after the city was retaken by the British and finds that intellectual and
      economic control of the city shifted from Muslim to Hindu hands because
      the British, at that time, saw an Islamic hand behind the mutiny.[181]
      Approximately 6,000 of the 40,000 British living in India were killed.

      The scale of the punishments handed out by the British "Army of
      Retribution" were considered largely appropriate and justified in a
      Britain shocked by embellished reports of atrocities carried out against
      British and British civilians by the rebels.[182] Accounts of the time
      frequently reach the "hyperbolic register", according to Christopher
      Herbert, especially in the often-repeated claim that the "Red Year" of
      1857 marked "a terrible break" in British experience.[178] Such was the
      atmosphere – a national "mood of retribution and despair" that led to
      "almost universal approval" of the measures taken to pacify the
      revolt.[183] Incidents of rape allegedly committed by Indian rebels
      against British women and girls appalled the British public. These
      atrocities were often used to justify the British reaction to the
      rebellion. British newspapers printed various eyewitness accounts of the
      rape of English women and girls. One such account was published by The
      Times, regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10 had
      been raped by Indian rebels in Delhi. Karl Marx criticized this story as
      false propaganda, and pointed out that the story was written by a
      clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events of the rebellion, with no
      evidence to support his allegation.[184] Individual incidents captured the
      public's interest and were heavily reported by the press. One such
      incident was that of General Wheeler's daughter Margaret being forced to
      live as her captor's concubine, though this was reported to the Victorian
      public as Margaret killing her rapist then herself.[185] Another version
      of the story suggested that Margaret had been killed after her abductor
      had argued with his wife over her.[186] During the aftermath of the
      rebellion, a series of exhaustive investigations were carried out by
      British police and intelligence officials into reports that British women
      prisoners had been "dishonored" at the Bibighar and elsewhere. One such
      detailed enquiry was at the direction of Lord Canning. The consensus was
      that there was no convincing evidence of such crimes having been
      committed, although numbers of British women and children had been killed
      outright.[187] The term 'Sepoy' or 'Sepoyism' became a derogatory term for
      nationalists, especially in Ireland. Bahadur Shah was arrested at
      Humanyun's tomb and tried for treason by a military commission assembled
      at Delhi, and exiled to Rangoon where he died in 1862, bringing the Mughal
      dynasty to an end. In 1877 Queen Victoria took the title of Empress of
      India on the advice of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. The rebellion saw
      the end of the East India Company's rule in India. In August, by the
      Government of India Act 1858, the company was formally dissolved and its
      ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown.[189] A new
      British government department, the India Office, was created to handle the
      governance of India, and its head, the Secretary of State for India, was
      entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India
      gained a new title, Viceroy of India, and implemented the policies devised
      by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as
      the Straits Settlements, became colonies in their own right. The British
      colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to
      integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and
      abolishing attempts at Westernization. The Viceroy stopped land grabs,
      decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service,
      albeit mainly as subordinates. Essentially the old East India Company
      bureaucracy remained, though there was a major shift in attitudes. In
      looking for the causes of the Rebellion the authorities alighted on two
      things: religion and the economy. On religion it was felt that there had
      been too much interference with indigenous traditions, both Hindu and
      Muslim. On the economy it was now believed that the previous attempts by
      the Company to introduce free market competition had undermined
      traditional power structures and bonds of loyalty placing the peasantry at
      the mercy of merchants and money-lenders. In consequence the new British
      Raj was constructed in part around a conservative agenda, based on a
      preservation of tradition and hierarchy. On a political level it was also
      felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had
      been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising. In
      consequence, Indians were drawn into government at a local level. Though
      this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set, with the
      creation of a new 'white collar' Indian elite, further stimulated by the
      opening of universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, a result of the
      Indian Universities Act. So, alongside the values of traditional and
      ancient India, a new professional middle class was starting to arise, in
      no way bound by the values of the past. Their ambition can only have been
      stimulated by Queen Victoria's Proclamation of November 1858, in which it
      is expressly stated, "We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian
      territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other
      subjects...it is our further will that... our subjects of whatever race or
      creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the
      duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and
      integrity, duly to discharge." Acting on these sentiments, Lord Ripon,
      viceroy from 1880 to 1885, extended the powers of local self-government
      and sought to remove racial practices in the law courts by the Ilbert
      Bill. But a policy at once liberal and progressive at one turn was
      reactionary and backward at the next, creating new elites and confirming
      old attitudes. The Ilbert Bill had the effect only of causing a white
      mutiny and the end of the prospect of perfect equality before the law. In
      1886 measures were adopted to restrict Indian entry into the civil
      service. The Bengal army dominated the Indian army before 1857 and a
      direct result after the rebellion was the scaling back of the size of the
      Bengali contingent in the army.[190] The Brahmin presence in the Bengal
      Army was reduced because of their perceived primary role as mutineers. The
      British looked for increased recruitment in the Punjab for the Bengal army
      as a result of the apparent discontent that resulted in the Sepoy
      conflict.[191] The rebellion transformed both the native and British
      armies of British India. Of the 74 regular Bengal Native Infantry
      regiments in existence at the beginning of 1857, only twelve escaped
      mutiny or disbandment.[192] All ten of the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments
      were lost. The old Bengal Army had accordingly almost completely vanished
      from the order of battle. These troops were replaced by new units
      recruited from castes hitherto under-utilised by the British and from the
      minority so-called "Martial Races", such as the Sikhs and the Gurkhas. The
      inefficiencies of the old organisation, which had estranged sepoys from
      their British officers, were addressed, and the post-1857 units were
      mainly organised on the "irregular" system. From 1797 until the rebellion
      of 1857, each regular Bengal Native Infantry regiment had had 22 or 23
      British officers,[193] who held every position of authority down to the
      second-in-command of each company. In irregular units there were fewer
      British officers, but they associated themselves far more closely with
      their soldiers, while more responsibility was given to the Indian
      officers. The British increased the ratio of British to Indian soldiers
      within India. From 1861 Indian artillery was replaced by British units,
      except for a few mountain batteries.[194] The post-rebellion changes
      formed the basis of the military organisation of British India until the
      early 20th century.
